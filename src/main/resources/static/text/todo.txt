BUGS:

FEATURES:
-Record type of pin (vertical, diagonal-ascending, horizontal, diagonal-descending, other)
-Reduce moves due to pin by removing all moves that don't match the type of pin
-Implement draw conditions such as too many turns without captures, repetition, insufficient material, etc.
-Over the Internet:
  -Host game on server somehow
  -Implement WebSockets to host communication with another person
-Move Recording:
  -Record captured pieces
  -Implement saving of moves in client-side storage (IndexedDB)
  -Implement going back and forth in moves (undo last move, redo last move)

USER CONVENIENCE:
-Add text blurb to the side of the board that alerts with messages based on events (e.x. "You can't make that move!")
-Display something with the side text when King is captured

REFACTORING:
-Generate front-end board with back-end results
-Just...refactor MoveCalcResultsStruct
-Change board keys to be numbers rather than strings
-Record the coordinate of each square within the square object
-Board (I think) isn't updated by pieces, only queried. Therefore, send in a copy of the board instead of the entire
 BoardManager instance
