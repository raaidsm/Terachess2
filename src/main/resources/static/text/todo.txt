BUGS:
-Fix checkmate and last-made-move not displaying properly
-Fix multi check case not accounting for being able to block double check from a piece that attacks through another

FEATURES:
-Implement flipping the board for player playing black
-Implement front-end waiting for back-end before continuing
-Player clock
-Implement choosing pawn promotion piece
-Implement draw conditions such as too many turns without captures, repetition, insufficient material, etc.
-Move Recording:
  -Record captured pieces
  -Implement saving of moves in client-side storage (IndexedDB)
  -Implement going back and forth in moves (undo last move, redo last move)

USER CONVENIENCE:
-Implement more secure way of sending user confirmation to specific users
-Implement verifying user identity in the database whenever they make a move
-Implement restarting the game through the front-end

REFACTORING:
-Implement efficient way of executing a move on the front-end using just the move details
-Generate front-end board with back-end results
-Just...refactor MoveCalcResultsStruct
  -Consider merging attackedSquareName and checkedSquareName into one variable
-Change board keys to be numbers rather than strings
-Record the coordinate of each square within the square object
-Board (I think) isn't updated by pieces, only queried. Therefore, send in a copy of the board instead of the entire
 BoardManager instance
