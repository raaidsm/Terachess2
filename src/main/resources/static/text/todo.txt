OVERALL PLAN:
-Starting position has a pre-defined set of legal moves
-Once a legal move is made, Java code calculates legal moves for every piece
  -This way, it knows if there is check/checkmate
-When JavaScript side selects a square, it queries the Java side for all legal moves for that piece
-When one of the legal moves is selected, the process repeats again

GENERAL:
-Break main.js code into modules
GAME LOGIC:
-Track which squares are attacked, and by which coloured piece
-Establish clause for checkmate
OVER THE INTERNET:
-Host game on server somehow
-Implement WebSockets to host communication with another person
MOVE RECORDING:
-Implement saving of moves in client-side storage (IndexedDB)
-Implement going back and forth in moves (undo last move, redo last move)
