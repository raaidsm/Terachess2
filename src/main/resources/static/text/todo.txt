  -Implement going back and forth in moves (undo last move, redo last move)

USER CONVENIENCE:

REFACTORING:
-Implement efficient way of executing a move on the front-end using just the move details
-Generate front-end board with back-end results
-Just...refactor MoveCalcResultsStruct
  -Consider merging attackedSquareName and checkedSquareName into one variable
-Change board keys to be numbers rather than strings

 BoardManager instance
