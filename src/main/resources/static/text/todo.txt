REFACTORING:
-Generate front-end board with back-end results
-Just...refactor MoveCalcResultsStruct
  -Consider merging attackedSquareName and checkedSquareName into one variable
-Change board keys to be numbers rather than strings
-Record the coordinate of each square within the square object
-Board (I think) isn't updated by pieces, only queried. Therefore, send in a copy of the board instead of the entire
 BoardManager instance
