REFACTORING:
-Generate front-end board with back-end results
-Just...refactor MoveCalcResultsStruct
-Change board keys to be numbers rather than strings
-Record the coordinate of each square within the square object
-Board (I think) isn't updated by pieces, only queried. Therefore, send in a copy of the board instead of the entire
 BoardManager instance

GAME LOGIC:
-Implement draw conditions such as too many turns without captures, repetition, insufficient material, etc.

BUGS:
-Record type of pin (vertical, diagonal-ascending, horizontal, diagonal-descending, other)
-Reduce moves due to pin by removing all moves that don't match the type of pin
-King's move calculation can lead to seemingly random squares being found as legal square moves
  -Issue might be deeply rooted or surface-level

OVER THE INTERNET:
-Host game on server somehow
-Implement WebSockets to host communication with another person

MOVE RECORDING:
-Record captured pieces
-Implement saving of moves in client-side storage (IndexedDB)
-Implement going back and forth in moves (undo last move, redo last move)
