REFACTORING:
-Rename Square to SquareStruct
-Implement saving instances of square to SquarePreviewStruct when it is initialized
  -This is so that the king has easy access to the square
-Just...refactor MoveCalcResultsStruct
-Break main.js code into modules

GAME LOGIC:
-Implement not being able to make moves when it's not your turn
-Implement King movement (currently kings can't move at all lol)
-Implement draw conditions such as too many turns without captures, repetition, insufficient material, etc.

BUGS:
-Overhaul move calculation system to calculate moves for both colours of pieces after a move is made to properly record
 attacks of a piece after it makes a move
-King's move calculation can lead to seemingly random squares being found as legal square moves
  -Issue might be deeply rooted or surface-level

OVER THE INTERNET:
-Host game on server somehow
-Implement WebSockets to host communication with another person

MOVE RECORDING:
-Record captured pieces
-Implement saving of moves in client-side storage (IndexedDB)
-Implement going back and forth in moves (undo last move, redo last move)
