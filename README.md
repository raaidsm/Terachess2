# Terachess2
Terachess 2 implementation using Java Spring Boot. Terachess 2 is a variant of the original Chess that adds more pieces, more rules, and more squares on the board!
It is an incredibly complex and fascinating take on the more than 1,400 year old game.
Though it is a game with a defined ruleset, it is very difficult to actually be able to play it.
As such. I have taken on this project as a way to provide that to people over the web!
I have currently implemented a stable build of the original game of Chess.
